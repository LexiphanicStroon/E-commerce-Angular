This is a full stack E-commerce app made using ASP.NET Core, and Angular. Programming was done using TypeScript on the front end, and C# for the back-end.
There are toasts (pop-ups) to let users know what error message is being thrown, an updating cart that calculates subtotals, LINQ Queries used to implement the database. There is also a helper class that will automatically convert number types based on which database is being used for deployment so as not to throw an error. SQLITE Doesn't like certain number types.
